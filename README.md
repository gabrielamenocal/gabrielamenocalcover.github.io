# gabrielamenocalcover.github.io - Version 2

I started getting the web developer skills since June 2018,  through Lynda online courses and University of Toronto School of continuing Education Boot Camp.  Please feel free to share your feedback and comments regarding my work as a new web developer, I'd appreciate your comments. In this version the different sectio of the resume are located in different HTML files instead of one HTML as the version 1.

If you believe some on my lines can be helpful for you, please feel free to use it.


Thanks in advance,
